# flappy-bird
This is a flappy bird clone I am making in godot 4 by floowing a [tutorial](https://youtu.be/lkDvTdbOIEo?si=1BMYsExiqtspcoxm) 

Then I changed the background and obstacles. The background has houses and a sky scraper and then obstacles are stop lights. I wanted to use the golden gate bridge as a obstacles but, could not make it. Maybe some day I will have the golden gate bridge as an obstacle. I also added background horrow music. And I changed the color of the ground to yellow and black to symbolize danger.
